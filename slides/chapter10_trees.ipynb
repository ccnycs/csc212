    "   1. There is one special node, called the root.\n",
    "   2. Each node may be associated with one or more different nodes, called its children. If a node c is the child ofanother node p, then we say that “p is c’s parent.”\n",

    "    4. If you start at any node and move to the node’s parent (provided there is one), then move again to that node’s parent (provided there is one), and keep moving upward to each node’s parent, you will eventually reach the root."
